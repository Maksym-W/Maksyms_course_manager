At the time of me writing this, https://cssc.utm.utoronto.ca/course-manager
is down. A shame, because I used it for all my courses.

This is my attempt at recreating it. For now, it will be in python, but who knows?
Maybe one day it have its own GUI

Alright, so its been almost a year since I made this, and since then Ive taken a database course. 
So, this would be a nice TODO for this project. Replace the text file I use to store data with a Database.
